    <h2>A 21st Century Revolution</h2>

      <p>It's remarkable that despite the interest given by some 
        young girls athletes to this particular sport, many sports investment 
        fimrs or owners in the past haven't sought to pay close attention to their 
        potentials.</p>
      <p class="bgimage">Fortunately, as the men's team did pretty good in the last decade 
        on the world stage, we are seeing more interest and money pooring into 
        US soccer teams development that eventually will attract even some 
        foreign stars.</p>
      <p>Just like any other sports, the future of our young talents will 
        be decided by <em><strong class="money"> resources and money</strong></em> we put in!</p>
